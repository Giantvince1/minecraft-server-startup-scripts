# minecraft-server-startup-scripts
This will be a collection of shell-based scripts designed to start up a Minecraft server, as well as perform sanity checks to ensure everything operates smoothly.
Shellscript version currently written to support BASH, DASH, ZSH, KSH, and ASH! PowerShell 7 coming soon!
Feel free to submit a PR if any changes need to be made for other shell types!

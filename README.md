# Minecraft Server Startup Scripts

This will be a collection of shell-based scripts designed to start up a Minecraft server, as well as perform sanity checks to ensure everything operates smoothly.

Shellscript version currently written to support BASH, DASH, ZSH, KSH, and ASH! PowerShell version coming soon! (I've created the file for it, but nothing is inside yet, stay tuned!)

Feel free to submit a PR if any changes need to be made for other shell types that you guys happen to use! So far, this script is 100% POSIX-compliant!

The mcrcon/LICENSE file specifies the copyright that applies to the included mcrcon CLI client for Linux and Windows machines. You can find it at: https://github.com/Tiiffi/mcrcon

These files are available in the mcrcon directory in the root of the project. These will definitely help for those who wish to use this as a background service!

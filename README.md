# minecraft-server-startup-scripts
This will be a collection of shell-based scripts designed to start up a Minecraft server, as well as perform sanity checks to ensure everything operates smoothly. Currently written only in Bash, PowerShell 7 coming soon! Feel free to submit a PR if any changes need to be made for other shell types!

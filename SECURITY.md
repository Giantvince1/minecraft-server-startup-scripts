## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability or other security issue, please create an issue, or if you have a proposed fix, you may create a pull request.

At that point, one of the code reviewers for this repository will go over the new code, and make sure it fixes the problem and doesn't introduce a worse one.

If it checks out and can merge right in, it will happen.
